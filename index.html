        "In 2023, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Marri Laxman Reddy Institute of Technology and Management." <br/> <br />
       "I've honed my HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript skills through self-taught means, such as building websites for friends and creating a wiki for a game I play. I completed a 7-month Coursera program (Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate) to further advance my abilities.<br/>
       As an aspiring professional, my long-term ambition is to establish a successful career as a full-stack developer. I am dedicated to acquiring the necessary skills and expertise to excel in this field, and I am constantly working towards achieving my goal.
